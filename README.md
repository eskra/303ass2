# 303ass2

The goal of this assignment was to create an airplane reservation system. 
I began using git and then ran into problems and revamped my whole take on the
problem. I have left the files there for anyone to look at, but they are incorrect.

The relevant files for the completed program are:

Airplane.java\n
Airplane$1.class\n
Automaticbroker.java\n
Automaticbroker.class\n
Manualbr.java\n
Manualbr$1.class\n

The remaining new files are from the generation of javadocs for this assignment.

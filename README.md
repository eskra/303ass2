# 303ass2

The goal of this assignment was to create an airplane reservation system. 
I began using git and then ran into problems and revamped my whole take on the
problem. I have left the files there for anyone to look at, but they are incorrect.

The relevant files for the completed program are:

Airplane.java <br />
Airplane$1.class <br />
Automaticbroker.java <br />
Automaticbroker.class <br />
Manualbr.java <br />
Manualbr$1.class <br />

The remaining new files are from the generation of javadocs for this assignment.
